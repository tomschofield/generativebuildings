# generativebuildings
Designed for Seven Stories, the national centre for children's books

Installation management instructions:

The application is built in the Java language processing.org and compiled for windows. 
The physical interaction uses an arduino microcontroller connected to the installation PC using a normal USB A-B cable. A circuit diagram and the code are in the github code repository

Opening and closing the application
The application is scheduled to open and close automatically using windows task scheduler
to open it manually double click on the icon 'generative_buildings' on the pc desktop
to close it manually press the escape key

Maintenance
The application is a stand alone and should not require updating. If future windows updates require java updates find the java runtime environment here https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html 

If the application itself needs updating follow instructions here to rebuild the app for windows https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Export-Info-and-Tips 

the windows pc should be allowed to self update regularly. We recommend that the wifi is usually left switched off and that an update schedule (once a week say) is introduced. 

Other maintenance or expansion requires a programmer with Java/Processing knowledge.
